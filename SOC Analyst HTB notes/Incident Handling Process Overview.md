#### Incident Handling Process
- like the cyber kill chain, there are different stages when responding to an incident 
- defines the capability for organizations to prepare, detect, and respond to malicious events
- suited for responding to IT security events
- stages do not correspond to stages of cyber kill chain
- As defined by NIST, the incident handling process consists of the following 4 distinct stages

- incident handlers spend most of time in **preparation and detection & analysis**
- when malicious event is detected we move on to the next stage and respond
	- but there should always be resources on the first 2 stages
	- process is not linear but cyclic
	- as new evidence is discovered, the next steps may change
- incident handling has two main activities, **Investigating and Recovering**
	- **Investigation** aims to
		- discover initial attack vectors(patient zero) and create an incident timeline
		- determine what tools and malware was used
		- document compromised systems and what adversary has done
	- **Recovery** follows after the investigation
		- involves creating and implementing recovery plan
		- business should resume if incident caused disruptions
- after incident is handled a report is issued, detailing cause and cost
- lessons learned activities are performed to prevent future incidents
