### Preparation Stage
-  has two separate objectives
	- establishing incident handling capability
	- ability to protect against and prevent IT security incidents e.g.
		- endpoint and server hardening
		- active directory tiering
		- MFA
		- privileged access management
	- activity is essential to overall success of team
		- but not responsibility of IH team

### Preparation Prerequisites
- ensure to have the following:
	- Skilled incident handling team members
		- can be outsourced but basic capability and understanding must be in house regardless
	- Trained workforce
		- through security awareness activities
	- Clear policies and documentation
- Tools (software and hardware)

### Clear Policies & Documentation
- Contact information and roles of the incident handling team members
- Contact information for the legal and compliance department, management team, IT support, communications and media relations department, law enforcement, internet service providers, facility management, and external incident response team
- Incident response policy, plan, and procedures
- Incident information sharing policy and procedures
- Baselines of systems and networks, out of a golden image and a clean state environment
- Network diagrams
- Organization-wide asset management database
- User accounts with excessive privileges that can be used on-demand by the team when necessary (also to business-critical systems, which are handled with the skills needed to administer that specific system). These user accounts are normally enabled when an incident is confirmed during the initial investigation and then disabled once it is over. A mandatory password reset is also performed when disabling the users.
- Ability to acquire hardware, software, or an external resource without a complete procurement process (urgent purchase of up to a certain amount). The last thing you need during an incident is to wait for weeks for the approval of a $500 tool.
- Forensic/Investigative cheat sheets

### Tools (software and hardware)
- Additional laptop or a forensic workstation for each incident handling team member to preserve disk images and log files, perform data analysis, and investigate without any restrictions (we know malware will be tested here, so tools such as antivirus should be disabled). These devices should be handled appropriately and not in a way that introduces risks to the organization.
- Digital forensic image acquisition and analysis tools
- Memory capture and analysis tools
- Live response capture and analysis
- Log analysis tools
- Network capture and analysis tools
- Network cables and switches
- Write blockers
- Hard drives for forensic imaging
- Power cables
- Screwdrivers, tweezers, and other relevant tools to repair or disassemble hardware devices if needed
- Indicator of Compromise (IOC) creator and the ability to search for IOCs across the organization
- Chain of custody forms
- Encryption software
- Ticket tracking system
- Secure facility for storage and investigation
- Incident handling system independent of your organization's infrastructure
- **jump bag** - would have many tools mentioned above ready to be picked up and leave immediately
