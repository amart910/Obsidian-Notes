- PowerShell is a command-line shell and scripting language that can run individual commands within the terminal as well as create and execute more complex scripts.
	- Useful when automating computer administration tasks
- Popular tool for automating Windows operating system tasks
- PowerShell commands are called *CmdLets* 
	- Their names are given a *"Verb"-"Noun"* command format
		- `Get-Date`

		- `Write-Host`
		- ![[Pasted image 20250705162418.png]]
		- `Get-Command` 
			- will output all available *Cmdlets*
			- can use arguments such as `-Verb Get`, which will find all Get commands
				- or `-Noun Host` for specific Nouns
				- ex: `Get-Command -Verb Get`, or `Get-Command -Noun Host`
		- `Clear-Host` will clear the terminal
- **Command Completion**
	- If you type a few letters of a command and then press `Tab` key, the terminal will autocomplete
		- If more than one command matches the partial command such as `Get-H`, `Tab` will list possible commands

- **Command History** is stored in a file in most modern terminals
	- can be accessed using `Get-History` 
	- You can also use up and down keys to cycle through command history
#### Writing Scripts
- To perform complex tasks requiring multiple commands, a PowerShell script is needed
- To run a script, we open any text editor, write our commands and name the file with a `.ps1` file extension. 
- The following commands are put into a script file called **host-commands.ps1**
- ![[Pasted image 20250705170121.png]]
- You can run the script in the terminal using **.\host-commands.ps1**
- ![[Pasted image 20250705170246.png]]
- The result will be:
- ![[Pasted image 20250705170315.png]]
- The **.\ notation before the script name tells the shell to look for a file in the current directory and run it.
	- In most shells forward slash notation **./** can be used
- Another example script:
- ![[Pasted image 20250705170702.png]]
- Output:
- ![[Pasted image 20250705170746.png]]
