### Arithmetic Operators
- perform specific operations on data, often stored in a variable 
- types of operators
	- Assignment Operators
	- Unary Operators
	- Comparison Operators
	- Logical Operators 
- **Arithmetic Operators** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
	 - are binary meaning they require two operands
		 - `<Operand_1> <Arithmetic-Operator> <Operand 2>`
	 - Are best utilized with variables
