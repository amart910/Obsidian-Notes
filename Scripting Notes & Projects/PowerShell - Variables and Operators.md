### PowerShell - Variables and Operators
- Regardless of our use case, one inevitable aspect of programming is storing and manipulating data to serve our needs.
- **Variables** are used to store a piece of data
	- can store the results of commands like values, names, paths, and settings
	- to create a value, we must assign a value
	- are referenced using a dollar sign `$` followed by a variable name 
	- then you assign a value using an equal sign `=` followed by the value for the variable

	- variables names consist of alphanumeric characters
		- are NOT case-sensitive and include spaces and special characters when enclosed in curly braces, `{}` 
		- but the convention is using only alphanumeric characters and the underscore `_` character
- **Variable reference** allows us to use or manipulate variables

	- Referencing the variable `my_string_variable` in the terminal prints out the value we assigned to it
- **User Input** 
	- A useful command to enable user input through the terminal

	- above example will output the `-Prompt` string and then wait for the user to input a value and hit Enter. 
		- the value will be stored in `$my_input` for use later

#### Variable Types and Advanced Usage
- common types of variables
	- `Int`: integers like `2`, `-5`, `99`
	- `Float`: decimal numbers like `2.1`, `0.9`, `14.06`
	- `String`: zero or more characters enclosed in double quotes like
		- `"Codecademy"`, `"3X4mP|3"`
	- `Boolean`: two possible values: `$True` and `$False`
	- `Array`: a collection of items like `25, "red", $False, 16.30`
- PowerShell assigns a type depending on the value assigned
	- this is called dynamic typing
	- Default type of any uninitialized variable is `$null`
	- Appending `.GetType().Name` to the variable reference can determine a variable's datatype.

		- the `GetType()` method returns the name and base property for a variable 
		- accessing the `Name` property only returns the data type we desire
		- variable's data type is `String`
- **Constrained Variables**
	- When initializing a variable, you can constrain it by specifying the type in brackets before referencing the variable
	- Attempting to assign a value of another type results in an error if PS can't convert it

- Create Multiple Variables
	- PS can create multiple variables using one statement
	- to initialize multiple variables with the same value:
		- ![Pasted image 20250705180501](../Networking%20and%20Security/Images/Pasted%20image%2020250705180501.png)
	- to assign multiple values to multiple variables:

### Environmental Variables (EV)
- store information related to the current environment
	- like OS and user sessions
	- can be accessed across commands and programs
	- OS usually creates them but can be configured 
	- benefits include that data stays consistent across processes
- ##### List Environment Variables
	- are stored as strings
	- use `Get-ChildItem` cmdlet on the `Env:` drive for complete list of existing environment variables
	- ![Pasted image 20250709140429](../Networking%20and%20Security/Images/Pasted%20image%2020250709140429.png)
	- to get the specific value of an EV use either:
	- ![[../Networking and Security/Images/Pasted image 20250709140614.png]]
	- Two popular variables in PowerShell are `HOME` and `PATH` 
		- `HOME` specifies current user's home directory
		- `PATH` includes all the directories where applications look for executables
#### Create an Environment Variable (EV)
- to create one the syntax is as follows
	- ![[../Networking and Security/Images/Pasted image 20250709190609.png]]
- by convention, EV names are usually capitalized
