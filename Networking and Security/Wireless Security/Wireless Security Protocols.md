### **Wireless Security Protocol:**

- Imagine you're at an airport, trying to connect to the internet. You see a list of Wi-Fi networks, some with padlock icons. Assuming the padlock indicates security, you choose one. But even though it's "locked," you're prompted for a password you don't know. Frustrated, you connect to an open network without a padlock. However, you've just unknowingly joined an unencrypted Wi-Fi hotspot, jeopardizing your data and privacy.

**Open Wi-Fi Risks:** Connecting to open Wi-Fi means your data is transmitted without encryption, making it easy for anyone nearby with the right tools to access it. Whether it's confidential work data or personal information, using open networks can lead to severe security breaches.

**Encryption Matters:** To mitigate this risk, connect only to Wi-Fi networks that require a password. However, not all encryption methods are equal in terms of security.

### **Encryption Standards:**

1. **3DES (Triple DES):**

- Uses DES algorithm thrice in sequence for encryption.
- Considered weak due to 56-bit encryption and vulnerabilities.
- Multiple independent keys enhance encryption complexity but not enough.
- Phased out by many organizations and standards due to security concerns.

2. **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard):**

- Secure encryption, available in 128-bit, 192-bit, or 256-bit key lengths.
- Longer keys exponentially harder to crack.
- Many devices and websites use AES-256 (256-bit version).
- Supports hardware acceleration (AES-NI) for fast encryption without performance impact.

3. **WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy):**

- Introduced in 1997, aimed to replicate wired network security for wireless.
- Uses 40-bit or 104-bit encryption keys.
- Vulnerable to brute-force attacks on standard hardware.
- Superseded by WPA due to security weaknesses.

4. **WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access):**

- Developed to overcome WEP's flaws.
- Uses variable-length alphanumeric passphrase (8 to 63 characters).
- Introduces temporal key integrity protocol (TKIP) for improved security.
- Generates a new encryption key for each packet sent.
- WPA2 and WPA3 follow to address vulnerabilities.

5. **WPA2:**

- Introduced in 2004, became wireless security standard.
- Mandatory support for CCMP (part of AES) for encryption.
- Addresses weaknesses in WPA.
- Vulnerabilities discovered over time led to the development of WPA3.

6. **WPA3:**

- Released in 2018 to improve WPA2's weaknesses.
- Increases minimum key strength.
- Eliminates passphrases with simultaneous authentication of equals (SAE) method.
- Implements forward secrecy for session key compromise.
- Encrypts management frames for better security.
- Recommended to use the latest supported standard for your devices and routers.

Remember, connecting to an open Wi-Fi network risks your data and privacy. Always choose networks with encryption and prefer the latest, most secure standard available.
