### **Application Security:** 
When developing web applications that require user credentials, considering federated identity management can enhance security and user experience. Federated identity management allows users to authenticate using credentials from established identity providers like Google, Facebook, or Twitter, eliminating the need for users to create new accounts.

### **Federated Identity Management:** 
Imagine Bob, a user, wants to log in to your application. Instead of creating new credentials, he chooses to log in using his Google account. When Bob clicks the Google authentication button, he's redirected to Google's login page. After he successfully logs in, Google sends your application a unique token confirming Bob's identity. This token doesn't expose his private data. This token can be used for future logins, eliminating the need for a separate username and password for your app. This approach enhances security by reducing the risk of a centralized database breach and simplifies the user experience.

### **Access Control:** 
After classifying data, determine who needs access and to what extent. Assign the least necessary access and group permissions instead of individual ones. In private clouds, leverage internal security authorization controls like Windows or Linux permissions. In public clouds, this relies on the cloud provider's identity and access management (IAM) services. In hybrid clouds, standardize IAM configurations across clouds to avoid inconsistencies and accidental over- or under-permissioning due to similar user/group names.

### **Network Security:** 
Public-facing servers are vulnerable to attacks, potentially allowing attackers to launch further attacks within your network. Isolation is key to minimizing damage. Host servers in a public cloud or an extranet in a private cloud. Extranets employ strict firewall rules and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to mitigate internal attacks.

### **Layered Security:** 
Security involves multiple layers. Even with private cloud firewalls, configure operating system firewalls on servers, even if not exposed to the internet. This defends against attackers breaching one layer and reaching another.

### **Remote Administration:** 
Managing cloud-based servers is crucial. In private clouds, administration can be done via a private network. For public servers, avoid direct internet access for remote administration. Instead, use virtual private networks (VPNs) or dedicated wide area network (WAN) connections to manage servers securely, as in a private cloud setup. This approach enhances security while allowing effective server management.

Overall, focusing on application security, access control, and network security strategies ensures the protection of data, user identities, and infrastructure in various cloud deployment scenarios.
