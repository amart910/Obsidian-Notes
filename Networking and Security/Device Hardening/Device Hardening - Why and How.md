### **Why Harden Devices?**

Harden devices refers to the process of securing network devices, such as switches, routers, firewalls, and servers, by implementing a series of security measures. This is crucial because these devices have access to sensitive data and control over network resources. If these devices are compromised, attackers could gain unauthorized access to data, manipulate firewall rules, and cause potential harm to the network. Wireless networks are particularly susceptible, as attackers can exploit vulnerabilities from a distance. Hardening aims to mitigate these risks and ensure robust security.

### **Harden Devices: How and Why?**

1. **Change Default Passwords:** Always change default passwords upon device installation. Attackers often exploit devices with unchanged default passwords, which are easily accessible on the internet. Changing passwords drastically reduces this risk.
    
2. **Remove Unnecessary Logins:** Eliminate unnecessary accounts, including default ones. Regularly review authorized users and remove accounts no longer required to prevent unauthorized access.
    
3. **Enforce a Strong Password Policy:** Strong passwords with complexity requirements and regular password changes enhance security. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) further fortifies access control.
    
4. **Remove Unnecessary Services:** Disable or remove unused features or services to reduce attack surfaces. Strengthen defenses by enabling features that enhance security.
    
5. **Keep Patches Up to Date:** Apply regular software updates and patches to fix vulnerabilities. Attackers may exploit known vulnerabilities if systems are not up to date.
    
6. **Limit Physical Access:** Physical access to a device equates to potential compromise. Lock up devices and monitor physical interactions to prevent unauthorized changes.
    
7. **Only Allow Changes from Trusted Networks:** Restrict changes to devices from trusted networks, preventing unauthorized alterations from the public side or other wireless devices.
    
8. **Require Encryption for Wireless Networks:** Ensure wireless networks use encryption (e.g., WPA2 or WPA3) to safeguard data from interception. Avoid sending confidential information over unencrypted networks.
    
9. **Audit Access:** Implement logging and auditing mechanisms to track user activity. Collect and review audit logs for signs of suspicious or unauthorized behavior.
    
10. **Backup:** Regularly backup device configurations and data. Store backups off-site to prevent loss due to disasters and facilitate device restoration.
    

#### **Conclusion:**

Harden devices is an essential practice to fortify network security. It prevents unauthorized access, manipulation, and potential breaches that could lead to data compromise. By following the steps outlined above, organizations can create a resilient security framework that protects sensitive information, network resources, and user access from potential threats and attackers.
