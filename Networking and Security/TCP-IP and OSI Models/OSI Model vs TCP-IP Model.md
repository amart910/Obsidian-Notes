#### OSI vs TCP/IP  
Learn more about the relationship between [Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)](Open%20Systems%20Interconnection%20(OSI).md) layers and [TCP-IP](TCP-IP.md) layers. 
1) Layers 1/2 of OSI and Layer 1 of TCP/IP Layers 1 and 2 of the OSI model correspond to Layer 1 of the TCP/IP model. Here, the information is received by the destination’s network router and physical addressing is added, directing it along the correct network path to the intended recipient.  
2) Layer 3 of OSI and Layer 2 of TCP/IP Layer 3 of the OSI model corresponds to Layer 2 of the TCP/IP model. Here, the segments are received and transmitted across the network as packets to the appropriate destination.  
3) Layer 4 of OSI and Layer 3 of TCP/IP Layer 4 of the OSI model corresponds to Layer 3 TCP/IP model. Here, the information is segmented, numbered, and sent across the network in reasonable sizes.  
4) Layers 5/6/7 of OSI and Layer 4 of TCP/IP The OSI model’s layers 5, 6, and 7 correspond to Layer 4 of the TCP/IP model. Here, the application is opened, the command is entered, information is encrypted, and the connection is established and maintained.
