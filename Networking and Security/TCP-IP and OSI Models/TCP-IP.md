- TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol
- Is a set of protocols used to connect network devices to each other.
- Is made up of four layers
1. Application Layer - Is responsible for the communication protocols between nodes 
	- Examples of protocols included in this layer:
			1. Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP and HTTPS) ports: tcp 80 and tcp 443
			2. Secure Shell (SSH) Port TCP 22
			3. Network Time Protocol UDP 123 
			4. and many others
2. Transport Layer - This layer is responsible for the end to end transport of data.
	- Protocols used in this layer are transmission control protocol (TCP) and User datagram protocol (UDP)
3. Network Layer - This layer defines the logical transmission protocols for the whole network.
	 - The main protocols used in this layer are internet protocol (IP), internet control message protocol (ICMP), and address resolution protocol (ARP)
4. Network Interface Layer -  This layer establishes how data should be physically sent through the network.
