Common Data-in-Transit Algorithms
#### **SSL/TLS Encryption:**

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and its successor TLS (Transport Layer Security) are widely used encryption protocols for securing data transmitted over the internet. TLS has become the preferred choice due to its enhanced security features. These protocols create a secure connection between a client (usually a web browser) and a server by exchanging a public key certificate. The certificate is issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) and contains the public key of the server.

During the TLS handshake, the client and server exchange encrypted messages to establish a symmetric encryption key, which is used to encrypt the actual data exchanged between them. This ensures that data transmitted over the network remains confidential and secure from interception.

#### **IPSec Encryption:**

IPsec (Internet Protocol Security) operates at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model and is used to secure IP network traffic. It's commonly used to create Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnels, allowing secure communication between networks or devices. IPsec provides both authentication and encryption to protect data in transit.

IPsec can be used in site-to-site configurations, where devices like firewalls or routers establish encrypted tunnels between them. This encapsulates the data, making it secure as it traverses potentially untrusted networks like the internet. IPsec uses protocols like the Authentication Header (AH) for data integrity and the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) for encryption.

### **Common Data-at-Rest Algorithms:**

#### **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES):**

AES is a widely used symmetric encryption algorithm for securing data at rest. It operates on blocks of data and uses a secret key for encryption and decryption. AES supports different key lengths, such as 128, 192, and 256 bits. It employs a series of transformations on the plaintext to generate ciphertext, making it extremely secure against unauthorized access.

AES is considered highly secure and is widely used for encrypting sensitive data in storage devices, databases, and other systems. Its strength lies in the complexity of its transformation process, making it resistant to decryption without the appropriate key.

#### **Conclusion:**

SSL/TLS encryption secures data transmitted over the internet, ensuring that data exchanged between clients and servers remains confidential. IPsec encryption is used to create secure tunnels between networks or devices, safeguarding data in transit. AES encryption is a powerful method for securing data at rest, employing strong encryption algorithms to protect stored information. These encryption methods collectively play a crucial role in maintaining data confidentiality and integrity across different scenarios.
