**Wi-Fi Security Protocols**

**Learning Objectives:**

1. Identify Wi-Fi security protocols.
2. Describe encryption techniques to secure data.
3. Identify the types of basic network media.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Wi-Fi Connectivity:** At places like airports, open Wi-Fi networks are abundant, some with security (padlock icons) and others without. Connecting to open Wi-Fi networks risks exposing data and identity to potential threats.
    
- **Unencrypted Traffic:** Connecting to open Wi-Fi networks means transmitting data without encryption, making it easily accessible to potential attackers.
    
- **Wi-Fi Security Protocols:** There are several security protocols available:
    
    1. **WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy):**
        - Introduced in 1997.
        - Provides 40-bit or 104-bit encryption.
        - Vulnerable to brute force attacks.
        - Deprecated in 2004 in favor of WPA.
    2. **WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access):**
        - Short-term solution to WEP's weaknesses.
        - Uses a variable-length passphrase (8-63 characters).
        - Introduced TKIP, generating a new 128-bit key for each packet.
    3. **WPA2:**
        - Introduced in 2004.
        - Uses CCMP, a part of AES encryption.
        - Offers data confidentiality, authentication, and access control.
    4. **WPA3:**
        - Released in 2018.
        - Addresses WPA2 weaknesses.
        - Increases key strength for enterprise mode.
        - Introduces the SAE method and forward secrecy.
- **Encryption Techniques:**
    
    1. **3DES (Triple DES):**
        - Uses the DES algorithm three times for encryption.
        - Has vulnerabilities and has been phased out by many entities.
    2. **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard):**
        - Highly secure.
        - Key lengths: 128-bit, 192-bit, or 256-bit.
        - Most modern devices support AES-256.
        - Benefits from hardware acceleration via CPU instruction (AES-NI).
- **Importance of Security:** Always choose the latest standard supported by devices and routers to ensure the utmost protection. Connecting to secure networks reduces the risk of data breaches and malicious activities.
    

By understanding and implementing appropriate Wi-Fi security protocols and encryption techniques, users can protect their data and identity when accessing networks, especially in public places. It's essential always to prioritize security when choosing a network and be wary of the risks of open Wi-Fi hotspots.
