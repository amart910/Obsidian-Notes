**Types of Firewalls:**

1. **Packet-Filtering Firewalls:**
    
    - **Description:** These operate mainly on the OSI model's network layer and make decisions based on source/destination IP address, protocol, and port number.
    - **Example:** If an office wants to block all incoming traffic from a specific IP address, a packet-filtering firewall can drop all packets coming from that address.
2. **Stateful Inspection Firewalls (or Dynamic Packet Filtering):**
    
    - **Description:** They keep track of active connections and make decisions based on the state and context of traffic, operating at the transport layer.
    - **Example:** If an internal user initiates a web request to an external site, the stateful firewall remembers this outbound request and allows the incoming response from that specific external site, even if inbound requests are generally blocked.
3. **Circuit-Level Gateways:**
    
    - **Description:** They operate at the session layer of the OSI model and make decisions based on the session's state and properties.
    - **Example:** They might allow a user to initiate an FTP session with an external server, but midway through, if the session starts behaving differently (like sending commands indicative of an attack), the gateway might terminate it.
4. **Application-Level Firewalls (or Proxy Firewalls):**
    
    - **Description:** These operate at the application layer and can inspect traffic all the way up to the actual content of the message, making decisions based on specific application protocols such as HTTP or FTP.
    - **Example:** A company might use an application-level firewall to block all traffic containing specific keywords or to block access to specific websites.
5. **Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs):**
    
    - **Description:** These combine features of the traditional firewalls with advanced capabilities like application awareness and deep packet inspection.
    - **Example:** An NGFW might allow employees to access Facebook but block them from using the Facebook Messenger feature.

**Firewall Features that Secure Networks:**

1. **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Firewalls use ACLs to identify allowed or denied traffic based on criteria like IP address, port, or protocol.
    
    - **Example:** A company might set up an ACL to block all traffic to port 23 to prevent Telnet access.
2. **Network Address Translation (NAT):** This feature hides internal IP addresses by translating them to a different public IP address.
    
    - **Example:** All internal users might appear to the external world as coming from a single IP address, thereby masking the internal network structure.
3. **Virtual Private Network (VPN) Support:** Many firewalls offer VPN capabilities to allow secure remote access to the internal network.
    
    - **Example:** Employees working from home can access office resources securely through a VPN.
4. **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS):** These monitor traffic for signs of malicious activity.
    
    - **Example:** If the firewall detects an IP address scanning multiple ports, it might block this IP, suspecting a port scanning attack.
5. **Application Awareness:** Firewalls with this feature can make decisions based on the specific application being accessed, not just the port or protocol.
    
    - **Example:** Even if traffic is on HTTP (port 80), the firewall might block specific websites or services like streaming or file sharing.

**Data Flow in the [[Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)]] Model:**

The OSI model has seven layers, each with a specific function:

1. **Physical Layer:** Deals with the physical connection (cables, switches).
2. **Data Link Layer:** Responsible for creating a reliable link between two directly connected nodes.
3. **Network Layer:** Determines the best path to transfer data between different networks.
4. **Transport Layer:** Ensures end-to-end communication, reliability, and data integrity.
5. **Session Layer:** Establishes, manages, and terminates sessions.
6. **Presentation Layer:** Transforms data to be ready for the application layer.
7. **Application Layer:** Interface where applications access network services.

**Example:** Consider sending an email:

- **Application Layer:** You compose an email in your email client.
- **Presentation Layer:** The email client formats the email properly.
- **Session Layer:** A session is established with the email server.
- **Transport Layer:** Your email is broken into chunks, and each chunk is given a sequence number.
- **Network Layer:** Determines the best path to the email server.
- **Data Link Layer:** Frames containing chunks of your email are sent to the router.
- **Physical Layer:** The data flows over cables (or wirelessly) to reach the router and then goes through the same process to reach the email server, moving from Physical up to Application layer at the server-side.

By breaking down communication into these layers, the OSI model helps standardize network functions and understand the flow of data across networks.
