A physical network could be comprised of a number of different devices in order to function as needed.

1) [Modem](Modem.md)  
	- A modem is a device necessary for sending and receiving data.  Modems allow computers to transport digital information over analog lines, such as phone or cable lines.  
	- Types of modems include cable modems, DSL modems, and satellite modems.  
2) [Router](Router.md) 
	 - A router is a point of connection between two or more networks that forwards data packets between networks.  
	 - To have internet in your home, you need an internet router that connects the networks on the internet to the network of your home. 
	 - You can access the internetâ€™s network either through a wired Ethernet port of via Wi-Fi.  
3) [Switch](Switch.md) 
	- A switch is used to connect devices in a specific network and allows them to communicate efficiently within the network.  
	- A switch is a more complex version of a hub, in that switches have the capability to add security measures and function far more intelligently, sending traffic directly from the sender to the receiver without the other devices being aware of the communication. 
	- Thus, a switch is less chatty and allows for more simultaneous conversations between devices.  Most internet routers include a switch in the form of wired or wireless Ethernet connections.  
4) [Bridge](Bridge.md) 
	- A bridge is similar to a router in that it connects two or more networks.  The difference is that the router analyzes data packets to determine where to send the packet next, whereas a bridge simply forwards the data to the next network without analysis. This make for fast data transfer that lacks versatility. 
	- Bridges are not widely used in modern networks, as routers and switches are the favored devices. 
5) [Repeater](Repeater.md) 
	- A repeater is a device used to strengthen, replicate, and regenerate signals that are weakened (for example, because of distance) during transmission.  In many large homes, the Wi-Fi signal does not extend to the end of the house farthest from the router. A range extender is a form or repeater that takes the distorted Wi-Fi signal and transmits is to the formerly dead zone.  
6) [Hub](Hub.md) 
	- A hub connects the router to the network, takes the data packets from the router, and sends them to all of the devices connected on the network.  An example is a USB hub. 
	- By connecting a USB hub to your computer, data packets are able to be transferred to multiple devices connected to your computer; each device then looks at only the traffic destined for it and ignores the rest.
